# Soil-erosion-practical
The aim of this practical is to have an idea of how coarse-resolution global models of soil loss and land surface processes can be used to study the soil organic carbon pool. We will make use of the CE-DYNAM model (Naipal et al., 2018, Biogeosciences), and we will only look at the carbon erosion rates triggered by soil removal on cropland. 
The Practical is accompanied by a general introduction into soil erosion and carbon modelling with land surface models.

The input data to execute the model is provided by the input.zip file.

Have a look at the Jupyter notebook Erosion_and_carbon_training.ipynb to see how the code and results looks like, and the steps that need to be followed to run the model.
